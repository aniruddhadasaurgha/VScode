        <h1>Pseudo Classes</h1>
        <div>
            <p>CSS pseudo-classes are used to define the special state of an element.</p>
            <p>For example, a link can be styled differently when it is hovered over or visited.</p>
            <p>In this example, we will demonstrate the use of pseudo-classes with a simple link.</p>
            <a href="https://www.example.com" class="example-link">Visit Example</a>
        </div>
        <div class="pseudo-classes">
            <p>Hover over the link to see the effect of the :hover pseudo-class.</p>
            <p>Click the link to see the effect of the :active pseudo-class.</p>
            <p>After visiting, the link will change color due to the :visited pseudo-class.</p>
            <p>When the link is focused, it will have a different style due to the :focus pseudo-class.</p>
            <p>When the link is disabled, it will have a different style due to the :disabled pseudo-class.</p>
            <p>When the link is enabled, it will have a different style due to the :enabled pseudo-class.</p>
            <p>When the link is checked, it will have a different style due to the :checked pseudo-class.</p>
            <p>When the link is not checked, it will have a different style due to the :not(:checked) pseudo-class.</p> 
            <p>When the link is first-child, it will have a different style due to the :first-child pseudo-class.</p>
            <p>When the link is last-child, it will have a different style due to the :last-child pseudo-class.</p>

            <p>When the link is nth-child, it will have a different style due to the :nth-child(2) pseudo-class.</p>
            <p>When the link is nth-last-child, it will have a different style due to the :nth-last-child(2) pseudo-class.</p>
