                    Codingal is a leading online coding education platform that empowers school students from Grades 1 to 12 (ages 5 to 17)
                    to learn and master the art of programming through a structured, engaging, and student-friendly approach. Launched in
                    2020 by Vivek Prakash and Satyam Baranwal, Codingal was created with a mission to inspire the next generation of
                    innovators, creators, and problem solvers by making computer science education accessible, effective, and fun.
                    
                    At its core, Codingal aims to bridge the gap between traditional education systems and the growing demand for digital
                    skills in the 21st century. It provides a comprehensive learning environment that combines live 1-on-1 classes,
                    interactive content, and real-world project development, all delivered by highly qualified and experienced coding
                    instructors. The platform’s curriculum is based on the internationally recognized K-12 Computer Science Framework and is
                    STEM.org accredited, ensuring that students receive a high-quality and globally relevant education.
                    
                    With a rapidly growing community of over 500,000 students across 70+ countries, Codingal is not just a learning
                    platform—it's a global movement that fosters creativity, analytical thinking, and confidence among young learners.
                    Whether a child is interested in building games, developing apps, designing websites, or exploring artificial
                    intelligence, Codingal provides the tools, guidance, and inspiration needed to turn curiosity into capability.
