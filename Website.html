            <p class="lead">Aviation is the science, technology, and practice of designing, building, and operating aircraft. It represents one of
            humanity’s greatest achievements, allowing people and goods to travel across the world in hours instead of weeks or
            months. The history of aviation began with early attempts at flight, such as kites in ancient China and Leonardo da
            Vinci’s flying machine sketches, but it truly took shape in the early 20th century. In 1903, the Wright brothers
            successfully conducted the first powered, controlled flight, marking the birth of modern aviation.</p>

            <p class="lead">
                Aviation can be broadly divided into civil aviation and military aviation. Civil aviation includes commercial airlines,
                cargo transport, private flying, and even space tourism. It has revolutionized global connectivity, tourism,
                international trade, and cultural exchange. Military aviation, on the other hand, is dedicated to defense and warfare,
                featuring fighter jets, bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, drones, and helicopters. Aircraft such as the MiG-31, F-35,
                and Sukhoi Su-57 are examples of modern high-performance military planes built for speed, stealth, and precision.
            </p>
            <p>Technologically, aviation combines multiple fields—aerodynamics, propulsion, materials science, navigation, and
            avionics. For instance, the lift equation,
            
            $$L = \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S C_L$$

            explains how wings generate lift, a principle fundamental to flight.</p>
