        <h1 id="h1">TEXT STYLING PROPERTIES IN HTML</h1>
        <h2 id="h2">Text styling is a fundamental aspect of web design and development. It involves modifying the appearance, layout, and
        behavior of text on a webpage to enhance readability, emphasize content, establish a visual hierarchy, and create a more
        engaging user experience.
        
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the basic structure of a webpage, including the content and semantic meaning
        of text elementsâ€”such as headings, paragraphs, emphasis, and lists. However, HTML alone offers limited visual
        customization.
        
        This is where CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) comes in. CSS is used to apply detailed styling rules to HTML elements,
        including fonts, colors, spacing, alignment, decorations, and transformations. With CSS, developers can create visually
        rich and responsive typographic designs that adapt to different screen sizes, devices, and user preferences.
        
        Together, HTML and CSS allow web developers to not only define what the text says but also how it looks and behaves,
        making them essential tools for creating polished, user-friendly websites.</h2>
        <div>
            <h2 id="h2">Text styling properties in HTML and CSS include:</h2>
           
        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="p1">1. CSS Classes:
            </p>
            <p class="p1">CSS classes are used to apply styles to multiple elements on a webpage. By defining a class in CSS and then applying it to HTML elements, developers can ensure consistent styling across similar elements.

            <p class="p1">2. CSS IDs:
            </p>
            <p class="p1">CSS IDs are unique identifiers for individual HTML elements. They are defined in CSS using the ID selector (e.g., #idname) and can be added to HTML elements using the id attribute. Unlike classes, which can be reused on multiple elements, an ID should be unique within a page.

            <p class="p1">3. CSS Inline Styles:
            </p>
            <p class="p1">Inline styles are CSS styles that are applied directly to an HTML element using the style attribute. This method allows for quick, one-off styling but is not recommended for large-scale projects due to maintainability issues.</p>
            <p class="p1">4. CSS Text Properties:
            </p>
            <p class="p1">CSS text properties control the appearance of text, including font size, font family, font weight, line height, letter spacing, and text alignment. These properties help create a visually appealing and readable typography.</p>
            <p class="p1">5. CSS Background Properties:</p>
            <p class="p1">CSS background properties are used to control the background of an element, including background color, background image, background position, background size, and background repeat. These properties help create visually engaging layouts and can enhance the overall design of a webpage.</p>
            <p class="p1">6. CSS Box Model:
            </p>
            <p class="p1">The CSS box model is a fundamental concept that describes how elements are rendered on a webpage. It consists of the content area, padding, border, and margin. Understanding the box model is essential for controlling layout and spacing in web design.</p>
            <p class="p1">7. CSS Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements:</p>
            <p class="p1">CSS pseudo-classes are used to define the special state of an element, while pseudo-elements are used to style a specific part of an element. Common pseudo-classes include :hover, :focus, and :nth-child(), while pseudo-elements include ::before and ::after.</p>
            <p class="p1">8. CSS Media Queries:</p>
            <p class="p1">CSS media queries are used to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device or viewport, such as screen size, resolution, and orientation. This allows developers to create responsive designs that adapt to various devices and screen sizes.</p>
            <p class="p1">9. CSS Transitions and Animations:</p>
            <p class="p1">CSS transitions and animations allow developers to create smooth visual effects and animations on elements. Transitions enable gradual changes between styles, while animations provide more complex, keyframe-based animations.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="p1">These properties and techniques are essential for creating visually appealing and user-friendly web pages. By combining HTML and CSS effectively, developers can create engaging and responsive designs that enhance the overall user experience.</p>
